# Konigsfold

A document ranking model for academic topics, sourcing articles from Wikipedia to create a learning path across a field. 

In topology, this model could begin you at the earliest discoveries in the field (the Seven Bridges of [Konigs]burg) and show you the natural process to get to a more relevant topic (like mani[fold]s). 

To run Konigsfold, run the Konigsfold.py file to receive instructions and submit a query.
