Euler characteristic - (not topic level, but predates topic)
Algebraic topology - REL ("top" level topic)
Abstract simplicial complex - (should be swapped with below)
Simplicial complex - (should be swapped with above) 
Betti number - REL (subtopic of above)
Cohomology - REL (new subtopic of algebraic topology)
Geometric topology - REL (new "top" level topic)
Knot theory - REL (subtopic of geometric topology)
Alexander polynomial - REL (discovery of knot theory)
Knot polynomial - REL (concept created by the previous)
Low-dimensional topology - REL (new subtopic of geometric topology)
Manifold - REL (subtopic in field of previous)
Neighbourhood (mathematics) - REL (concept in previous)
Neighbourhood system - REL (more detail on previous)
Poincaré conjecture - REL (discover branching off manifolds)
Sphere - (relevant to previous, but should be a higher level concept)
Hairy ball theorem - (unrelated to things around it, does not predate following documents)
Lefschetz fixed-point theorem - REL (relevant to previous)
Riemann–Hurwitz formula - (unrelated to surrounding results, does not predate later concepts)
Graph Theory - (should probably be an offshoot of geometric topology or Konigsberg, not top level)
Seven Bridges of Königsberg (should come earlier, too much nesting)
